    <div class="title">How the Web Works</div>
    <div class="description">
      The web consists of people and computers communicating with each other via 3 main components:<br>
      * browser - computer/human interface for the web; i.e., Mozilla, Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome<br>
      * internet - the world's largest computer network<br>
      * servers - host files with content including text, audio, images and video<br>
    </div>
    <div class="title">HTML</div>
    <div class="description">
      HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain text content which describes "what you see" and markup which describes "how it looks". For more information about current HTML standards check out <a href = "http://www.w3.org/html/">the w3.org page</a>.
    </div>
    <div class="title">Tags and Elements</div>
    <div class="description">
      HTML elements consist of HTML tags + content.  The tags contain formatting information telling the browser how the associated content should appear and function; i.e., <b>bold</b>, <em>italicized</em>, simple content or a <a href = "http://www.udacity.com">link to another webpage</a>.  Most HTML tags have the format <b>
      &lt;opening tag&gt; <em>content </em>&lt;/closing tag&gt;</b> although some, like the image source tag, are designed without a closing tag.

    <div class="title">Why Computers are Stupid</div>
    <div class="description">
      Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause unintended behavior in a program.
    </div>
    <div class="title">Inline vs Block Elements</div>
    <div class="description">
      HTML elements are either <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them, imparting additional formating attributes.
    </div>
    <div class="title">Box sizing</div>
    <div class="description">Boxes have 4 characteristics.  Working from the inside out they are content, padding, border and margin.  It is best to set sizes as a percentage rather than in pixels, although a maximum size may be specfied in pixels.</div>

    <div class="title">Box positioning</div>
    <div class="description">The Flex box allows divs to appear side by side on the page rather than the default of appearing on sequential separate lines.  Use webkits to enable flex boxes to work properly in different browsers.</div>
    <div class="title"> CODE - TEST - REFINE</div>
    <div class="description">
    1. Look for natural boxes on the design mockup.<br>
    2. Look for repeated styles and semantic elements.<br>
    3. Write your HTML.,br.
    4. Apply styles from the biggest elements to the smallest.  Use classes to describe styles for repeated elements efficiently, without repetition.<br>
    6. Fix things.  Save your file and refresh the browser to check your changes as you go.  Use Chrome developer tools to model style changes quickly, then transfer the best settings to your code file.<br>
    6. Check your code<br>
